# Convex-Optimization-final-project
Optimizing  the formula : Trace(SK) - log(|K|)  where K is a k-band matrix and S is PSD 
using various methods which are based on GS and using statistical tools to help us initialize hyper parameters for the optimization process.

The project includes 2 files , the report and the code we used.
